This project checks if the frequency of a song is 432Hz or not.

Why 432Hz?

432Hz is considered the natural frequency of the universe, embraced by great composers like Bach and Beethoven to craft music that touches the soul. This indicates that the universal music scale utilized 432A for tuning their instruments. However, during World War II, this was altered to 440Hz, which resembles the static of a radio—disorienting and unsettling. In contrast, 432Hz fosters harmony and a sense of flow. It’s the ideal frequency, one that feels organic and uplifting! Nature truly is wonderful!
